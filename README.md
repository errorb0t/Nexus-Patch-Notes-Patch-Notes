## Dec 25, 2025
- Nexus Patch Notes updated! Here is a list of the latest changes.
- All documented and undocumented changes to Battlegrounds from 2019 to today added.
- Names of Heroes and Battlegrounds added near icons in the Patches tab, so that we can use [Ctrl + F] for searching them. The layout has been changed as a consequence.
- Clicking on the change types in the legend (PTR to Live, Undocumented) now jumps to the next Patch Notes featuring the same change type instead of jumping to Patch Notes featuring any change type.
- The change type "Updated" has been removed. This change type only represented corrections made by Blizzard within Patch Notes. As such, it was only used in extremely rare cases.
- Hero availability changes for Same Hero ARAM added to the corresponding Patch Notes.
- The buttons for Tabs, the headers of Heroes and Battlegrounds tables, and the icons and labels for Battlegrounds and Heroes in Patches now follow the sams colour theme as other interactive elements (changing from cyan to blue on mouse over).
- Cho's Consuming Blaze changes removed from Blaze's Patch Notes.
- Patch Notes updated to include the latest documented and undocumented changes (last updated on 16 December 2025, with the previously reverted patch going live with some bug fixes).
